\section{Introduction}

The shift from 4G to 5G has been a generational leap has revolutionized connectivity around the world. 
Despite 5G being still in its early adoption rate at the time of writing \cite{5GStatisticsTaylor}, the research community is already working on the next generation of wireless communication technologies, 6G. 
6G technology is expected to enable a wide variety of new use cases, thanks to the increases in both data rates and latency but this in turn 
will also bring forth new security challenges, specific to those applications. 

One of the main differences between 5G and 6G technology will be the focus of the 6G standard in regards to 
AI integration. While Software Defined Networks (SDN) have played a key role in improving the efficiency and security 
of 5G networks, 6G is expected to take this a step further, by integrating artificial
intelligence and machine learning directly into the network. This is what the authors of \cite{6GRoadmapLetaief} define as 
the shift from \textit{Softwarization} to \textit{Intelligentization}.

AI integration in 6G networks will greatly strengthen the security of the network against security threats. 
By leveraging Diagnostic Analytics, a collection of insights into the status of the networks, security teams 
will be able to train specific AI models to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

In this paper we will focus on a specific aspect of the security of 6G networks, namely we will provide a machine learning based approach 
for the detection of jamming attacks in networks of drones. 

The paper is divided in 5 sections: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Topic overview:} In this section we will discuss how drones can benefit from integration in 6G network, analyze jamming attacks, their types, mitigation and detection. Finally we will discuss the advantages of an edge AI approach for jamming detection. 
	\item \textbf{Materials and methods:} In this section we will define the scenario that we decided to analyze as well as the dataset, algorithm and evaluation metrics we chose for our tests. 
	\item \textbf{Numerical Results:} In this section we will present the testing methodology as well as the numerical results that we obtained. 
	\item \textbf{Discussion:} In this section we will discuss the results obtained in the previous section and highlight notable trends.
	\item \textbf{Conclusions:} In this section we will summarize the results and discuss possible future research directions.

\section{Topic Overview}

\subsection{Drones in 6G Networks}

Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are defined as \textit{all aircraft designed to fly
without a pilot on board} \cite{DronesEC}. This technology has experienced rapid growth in recent years and is expected to 
keep growing in both the consumer sector as well as the commercial and military sectors \cite{DronesStatisticsLaricchia}.

In report 22.886 \cite{5GV2XSultan} 3GPP, the organ responsible for the development and maintenance of the 5G standard, identifies some of the envisioned use cases for 5G V2X (Vehicle-to-
Everything) communication services. Among these use cases, the report identifies vehicle platooning, advanced and remote driving end extended situational awareness as some of the main benefits
of V2V communication. All these use cases can be leveraged by a 6G drone network to achieve fast and reliable drone-to-drone communication, that, with the integration of artificial intelligence 
would allow the drones to act autonomously in a coordinated manner. 

This would prove useful in a variety of fields: from autonomous soil and crop health assessment as well as irrigation in agriculture, 
delivery of life saving supplies and locating of survivors in disaster response, in the delivery sector as a more eco friendly alternative to traditional 
delivery options and possibly in the mobility sector as a complement to traditional taxis and public transportation \cite{DroneCommHassija}. 

The effectiveness of drones in the military sector is widely recognized, both for high and low end models. For example, in the Ukraine war even cheap FPV drones 
mounted with explosives were successfully used to destroy much more expensive equipment \cite{DroneCombatUkraine}. 

Security against Jamming attacks is crucial in all these applications, especially in a safety critical environment. 

\subsection{Understanding Jamming Attacks}

Jamming attacks are a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that aims at disrupting the communication between two or more devices. 
This is achieved by transmitting a powerful signal on the same frequency as the one used by the devices to communicate. If the jamming signal is strong enough, 
it is able to overwhelm the legitimate signal, effectively blocking the communication between the devices \cite{DroneCommHassija}. 
Since the ability to communicate is affected, Jamming attacks falls under the umbrella of attacks that target the \textit{Availability} of the service in the CIA triad classification \cite{DataIntegrityCawthra}. 
Jamming attacks can be classified into 5 main categories, based on the attack pattern of the jammer: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constant Jamming:} Constant jamming is the simplest form of jamming attack. In constant jamming, the jammer is active all the time. 
    \item \textbf{Periodic Jamming:} The jammer simply transmits a strong signal on the same frequency as the devices it wants to disrupt 
    for a certain period of time \(t_a\), then stops transmitting for another period of time \(t_b\). This type of jamming attack is particularly effective against devices 
    that are not able to change their frequency and has the ability to disrupt the transmission of a sequence of consecutive packets. \cite{VANETsAI-Lyamin}
    \item \textbf{Random Jamming:} In random jamming, the jammer is active at random intervals, giving each transmitted packet a probability 
    \(p\) of being jammed \cite{VANETsAI-Lyamin}. 
    \item \textbf{Reactive Jamming:} A reactive jammer starts transmitting its jamming signal only when it senses energy in the communication channel, 
    indicating that a legitimate transmission is taking place. This type of jamming attack is more power efficient compared to other 
    operation types, as it only transmits its signal when it is needed\cite{MLMisbehavior5GBoualouache}.
    \item \textbf{Smart Jamming:} A smart jammer is a more sophisticated type of jammer that is able to adapt its jamming signal to 
    maximize the disruption of the communication between the devices. Smart jammers are able to modify their attack pattern based on the 
    transmission specifics of the devices they are targeting and are able to adapt to changes in the communication channel\cite{AntiJammingV2V-Feng}.
\end{itemize}

An effective Jamming detection AI model should achieve a high detection score against all the different types of jamming attacks.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
