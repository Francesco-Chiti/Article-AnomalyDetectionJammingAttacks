\section{Introduction}

The shift from 4G to 5G has been a generational leap has revolutionized connectivity around the world. 
Despite 5G being still in its early adoption rate at the time of writing\cite{5GStatisticsTaylor}, the research community is already working on the next generation of wireless communication technologies, 6G. 
6G technology is expected to enable a wide variety of new use cases, thanks to the increases in both data rates and latency but this in turn 
will also bring forth new security challenges, specific to those applications. 

One of the main differences between 5G and 6G technology will be the focus of the 6G standard in regards to 
AI integration. While Software Defined Networks (SDN) have played a key role in improving the efficiency and security 
of 5G networks, 6G is expected to take this a step further, by integrating artificial
intelligence and machine learning directly into the network. This is what the authors of \cite{6GRoadmapLetaief} define as 
the shift from \textit{Softwarization} to \textit{Intelligentization}.

AI integration in 6G networks will greatly strengthen the security of the network against security threats. 
By leveraging Diagnostic Analytics, a collection of insights into the status of the networks, security teams 
will be able to train specific AI models to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

In this paper we will focus on a specific aspect of the security of 6G networks, namely the detection of 
jamming attacks in drone networks.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1}, Table~\ref{tab1}, etc.

(\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.\label{fig1}}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
\end{adjustwidth}

% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape
%\begin{table}[H] %% Table in wide page
%\caption{This is a very wide table.\label{tab3}}
%	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCCC}

%		Entry 1		& Data			& Data			& This cell has some longer content that runs over two lines.\\
%		Entry 2		& Data			& Data			& Data\textsuperscript{1}\\

%	\begin{adjustwidth}{+\extralength}{0cm}
%		\noindent\footnotesize{\textsuperscript{1} This is a table footnote.}
%	\end{adjustwidth}
%\end{table}
%\finishlandscape


Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
